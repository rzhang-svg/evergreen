## Created and Implemented Features
- For the coding Challenge I was able to implement the backend Graphene Database to display the Vendor Data
- For Admins I added the drop down fields and gave them the ability to edit the Vendor Category and Status
- I was also able to implement the CSV export for the table
- For simplicity I added 2 users to the SQLalchemy Database and had an isAdmin Field
- Non Admins can only see the data and can't interact with any of it while Admins have access to the edit features and the CSV download

## Reflections and Painpoints
- I was able to come up with the graphQL queries to filter based on the Vendor status, Vendor risk, and Vendor category.
- I was not able to implement the FilterBar as I had Hoped I think my main Issue is I want to rerun a query rather than work with the data I already am given so I would have to do more state manipulation
- I think there are definitely packages out there for React Tables that have filtering capacity and can help with the filtering In this regard I think I tunnel visioned too hard without looking up more npm packages

## Notes
- I designed the filtering header but was unable to Finish so I left it in the code but I can remove it for visibility

Thanks for taking the time to give me this challenge
Cheers,
Robert
